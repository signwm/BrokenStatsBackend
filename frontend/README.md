# Frontend

This folder contains a very small web page used to view data from the backend.

## Running

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API listens on `http://localhost:5005`.

2. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5005/`.
   The page lists fights grouped by instances and fetches data from the backend automatically.
